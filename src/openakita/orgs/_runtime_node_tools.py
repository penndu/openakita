"""``_runtime_node_tools.py`` -- v2 orgs node-level tool resolution + execution.

Sprint-5 P0-1 (audit ``_orgs_business_capability_audit_v5.md`` §5.2 / §7.1)
lands the **D4 minimum-viable cut**: per-node ``external_tools`` declared on
the v1 ``OrgNode`` (which is what every aigc-video-studio v16-* test org
materialises into) are resolved into a real Anthropic-shaped tool list and
passed to :meth:`Brain.messages_create_async`. When the LLM emits a
``tool_use`` block the node agent runs the handler via the same global
:data:`openakita.tools.handlers.default_handler_registry` the v1 chat path
uses, splices the ``tool_result`` block back into the conversation, and
calls the brain a **second** time so the LLM can finalise its reply.

Sprint-5 shipped a one-round bound; the test7 quality RCA (2026-06)
lifted it to a **bounded, budget-guarded multi-round ReAct loop** (see
:data:`MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` / :data:`MAX_TOOL_CALLS` and the docstring of
:func:`run_with_tools`) so a node can iterate
(search -> search again -> write) instead of delivering its raw
mid-reasoning. MCP servers and skill SKILL.md auto-loading remain
deferred (audit §7.1 ``Not in P0-1 scope``).

### Why mirror v1 and not re-implement

The v1 chat path already wires every system tool handler (filesystem,
research, memory, planning, web_fetch, web_search, ...) into the global
:class:`SystemHandlerRegistry`. The orgs_v2 node path was sending
``tools=[]`` to the brain and therefore the v16 LLM debug dumps reported
``tools_count = 0`` for every workbench dispatch (audit v5 §5.2.2). By
reusing the same registry we:

* avoid duplicating handler implementations,
* benefit from any future tool the main agent gains for free,
* keep the per-node *whitelist* mechanic (``external_tools``) as the
  single source of truth for what a node may call,
* and stay zero-dependency on the workbench / MCP plumbing that the
  workbench nodes will eventually need (those routes through plugin
  manifests, which v2 does not consume yet).

### What is intentionally out of scope

* **Workbench (``hh_*``) tools** -- those live in the
  ``happyhorse-video`` plugin manifest. The plugin handler registry is
  separate from :data:`default_handler_registry`; binding it requires
  the workbench wiring tracked under the D4-ext follow-up. We **filter
  unknown tool names** so the LLM still gets the standard subset
  (research / planning / filesystem / memory etc) and the node can do
  *something* useful even on a workbench node.
* **MCP servers** declared on ``node.mcp_servers`` -- ignored for now
  (audit §7.1 explicit ``Not in P0-1 scope``).
* **Skill SKILL.md auto-load** (D4-ext) -- deferred.

    Loop semantics (quality root-fix, test7 RCA 2026-06):

    * Each iteration calls the brain, extracts ``tool_use`` blocks and,
      if there are none, returns the response as the FINAL answer.
    * When the LLM emits ``tool_use`` we run each tool sequentially,
      splice the ``tool_result`` blocks back in, and loop -- so the node
      can iterate (search -> search again -> write) instead of being
      forced to "finalise" after a single tool call (which is what made
      it deliver raw ``thinking…`` mid-reasoning).
    * The loop is bounded by :data:`MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` rounds AND
      :data:`MAX_TOOL_CALLS` total tool executions. When either budget is
      exhausted we make ONE last call with ``tools=[]`` so the LLM is
      forced to emit a clean text answer instead of another ``tool_use``
      turn that we would otherwise return verbatim.

    The ``second_round_caller`` parameter is a test hook: when given it
    is used for every brain call AFTER the first, so existing one-round
    fixtures keep asserting on the spliced ``tool_result`` history.
