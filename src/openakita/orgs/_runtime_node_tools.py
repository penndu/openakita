"""``_runtime_node_tools.py`` -- v2 orgs node-level tool resolution + execution.

Sprint-5 P0-1 (audit ``_orgs_business_capability_audit_v5.md`` §5.2 / §7.1)
lands the **D4 minimum-viable cut**: per-node ``external_tools`` declared on
the v1 ``OrgNode`` (which is what every aigc-video-studio v16-* test org
materialises into) are resolved into a real Anthropic-shaped tool list and
passed to :meth:`Brain.messages_create_async`. When the LLM emits a
``tool_use`` block the node agent runs the handler via the same global
:data:`openakita.tools.handlers.default_handler_registry` the v1 chat path
uses, splices the ``tool_result`` block back into the conversation, and
calls the brain a **second** time so the LLM can finalise its reply.

This is intentionally a one-round bound: see the module-level constant
:data:`MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS` and the docstring of
:func:`run_with_tools`. Multi-round ReAct, MCP servers, and skill
SKILL.md auto-loading are deferred (audit §7.1 ``Not in P0-1 scope``).

### Why mirror v1 and not re-implement

The v1 chat path already wires every system tool handler (filesystem,
research, memory, planning, web_fetch, web_search, ...) into the global
:class:`SystemHandlerRegistry`. The orgs_v2 node path was sending
``tools=[]`` to the brain and therefore the v16 LLM debug dumps reported
``tools_count = 0`` for every workbench dispatch (audit v5 §5.2.2). By
reusing the same registry we:

* avoid duplicating handler implementations,
* benefit from any future tool the main agent gains for free,
* keep the per-node *whitelist* mechanic (``external_tools``) as the
  single source of truth for what a node may call,
* and stay zero-dependency on the workbench / MCP plumbing that the
  workbench nodes will eventually need (those routes through plugin
  manifests, which v2 does not consume yet).

### What is intentionally out of scope

* **Workbench (``hh_*``) tools** -- those live in the
  ``happyhorse-video`` plugin manifest. The plugin handler registry is
  separate from :data:`default_handler_registry`; binding it requires
  the workbench wiring tracked under the D4-ext follow-up. We **filter
  unknown tool names** so the LLM still gets the standard subset
  (research / planning / filesystem / memory etc) and the node can do
  *something* useful even on a workbench node.
* **MCP servers** declared on ``node.mcp_servers`` -- ignored for now
  (audit §7.1 explicit ``Not in P0-1 scope``).
* **Multi-round ReAct loop** -- we run **exactly one** tool round and
  then ask the LLM for a final answer. Multi-round is the next-sprint
  follow-up; without it the simplest "fetch + describe" tasks already
  work, which is what the v17 audit needs to observe.
* **Skill SKILL.md auto-load** (D4-ext) -- deferred.

# Org node agents share the desktop Agent's FileTool, whose ``_resolve_path``

# real package location so it holds regardless of CWD. It deliberately does
# NOT restrict writes to ``data/`` or to user-chosen output paths.

      so the LLM can decide how to proceed; this matches the v1
      :class:`ToolExecutor` policy (an unknown / failing tool returns a
      structured error string rather than blowing up the whole turn).

    Sprint-6 P0-1 (RCA ``_v17_p1_rca.md`` §1.5): the host's
    ``handler_registry`` is the *populated* one from the desktop
    Agent (filesystem / memory / web_search / 20 system handlers +
    every plugin-registered tool). When ``tool_host`` is ``None`` we
    fall back to the Sprint-5 global registry path so headless test
    fixtures and the FastAPI lifespan-race window (host not yet
    wired) keep working -- the fallback will still emit
    ``node_tool_failed`` for unknown tools, byte-for-byte v17
    observable.

    Cancellation is propagated unchanged -- if the surrounding task is
    cancelled we re-raise :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` so the cancel
    pipeline (Sprint-3 P0-2) keeps working through tool execution.

    a final answer; 1 when the LLM emitted at least one ``tool_use``
