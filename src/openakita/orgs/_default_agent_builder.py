"""Default ``AgentBuilderProtocol`` -- minimum viable LLM binding for orgs_v2.

Sprint-2 P0-1 (audit ``_orgs_business_capability_audit_v2.md`` §5 / §8)
shipped the bare LLM binding: every node could finally produce one line of
LLM text instead of bouncing off ``_NullAgentBuilder``. Sprint-3 P0-1
(audit v3 §5.2) plumbed the real entry-node id end-to-end so the executor
stopped seeing ``node_id=None``.

Sprint-4 P0-1 (audit ``_orgs_business_capability_audit_v4.md`` §6.2 /
§8) tackles the remaining "single-LLM cosplay" symptom: even after
Sprint-3 the v15 run showed 35/35 commands had only one unique node id
in their LLM debug files (always ``producer``). The producer LLM was
inventing screenwriter / art-director "voices" inside one call rather
than really handing work off to those nodes.

This module now supports an **explicit XML dispatch syntax** that the
root node's system prompt teaches:

* The producer's LLM may emit zero or more
  ``<dispatch target="screenwriter">child instruction</dispatch>``
  blocks inside its reply.
* :class:`_BrainBackedNodeAgent` parses up to
  :data:`MAX_DISPATCH_BLOCKS` such blocks and, for each one, calls back
  into the injected ``dispatch_callback`` (wired by the executor) with
  the child node id + content.
* The callback recurses through the same executor pipeline so each
  child gets its own :class:`_BrainBackedNodeAgent`, its own
  ``agent_run_started`` / ``agent_run_finished`` events, its own
  artefact write (Sprint-4 P0-2), and its own ``context.node_id`` in
  LLM debug.
* Recursion is bounded by :data:`MAX_DISPATCH_DEPTH` so a runaway LLM
  cannot trigger an unbounded fan-out. Depth tracking flows through a
  module-level :class:`contextvars.ContextVar` set by the executor in
  ``activate_and_run``.
* Children run **serially** in this commit: it keeps cancel propagation
  simple (a single ``CancelledError`` unwinds the whole tree) and makes
  the LLM debug ordering deterministic; parallel ``asyncio.gather``
  fan-out is reserved for the next sprint.

The dispatch tutorial is only spliced into the system prompt at
``depth == 0`` so children (and grandchildren) do not get the "you may
dispatch" instructions and therefore cannot recurse further on their
own initiative even before the depth gate fires.

Sprint-4 P0-2 (audit v4 §5.4 / §6.2 #2) -- node artefact persistence -
is implemented at the executor layer (see
:mod:`._runtime_node_artifacts`), not here, because the executor is the
only layer that already owns the post-success bookkeeping (events,
emit, error mapping) and has clean access to the
``get_org_dir`` lookup. The builder stays small and stateless.

**Out of scope** (intentionally deferred to next sprint):

* Parallel ``asyncio.gather`` child fan-out.
* Inter-node memory retrieval at prompt time (the next node's prompt
  does not yet read the previous node's persisted memory).
* Node-level tool / skill / MCP injection (D4).
* Aggregator / Router / Retriever / Persister builder classes
  (still encoded inside this module + ``_runtime_dispatch.py``).

The builder is intentionally fail-fast: if the brain provider returns
``None`` (lifespan ordering -- HTTP up before the desktop ``Agent`` is
ready) we raise :class:`BuilderUnavailable`, which the executor catches
and turns into ``agent_run_failed reason=agent_build_failed``. That is
the same observable as the legacy ``_NullAgentBuilder`` path, so
downstream contracts (events.jsonl + SSE shape, ``get_status`` reading)
keep working unchanged.

class DefaultAgentBuilder:
    """Production :class:`AgentBuilderProtocol` (Sprint-2 P0-1).

    The builder is constructed by the API server lifespan
    (``api/server.py`` ``create_app``) before the desktop ``Agent`` is
    available. To handle that ordering without ``app.state`` reach-ins
    inside the orgs subsystem, callers pass a ``brain_provider``
    callable that the builder dereferences each :meth:`build` -- the
    desktop ``Agent`` is wired into ``app.state.agent`` later by
    ``main.py`` and the closure picks it up on first use.

    Sprint-4 P0-1: optionally accepts a ``dispatch_callback`` that the
    built :class:`_BrainBackedNodeAgent` invokes when the LLM emits
    ``<dispatch target="...">...</dispatch>`` blocks. The callback is
    wired by the runtime composition root to point back at
    :meth:`AgentPipelineExecutor.dispatch_subtask`. Leaving it as
    ``None`` (the default) restores Sprint-3 behaviour byte-for-byte,
    so unit tests / parity gates that instantiate the builder
    standalone keep working without changes.
