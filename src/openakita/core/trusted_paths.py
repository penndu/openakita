"""Session/workspace trusted-path metadata helpers (Fix-11).

These helpers maintain session-scoped trust metadata consumed by PolicyV2.
They do not classify natural-language user messages and must not bypass
tool-declared RiskGate requirements.

1. **Built-in trusted patterns** — the user explicitly created a scratch
   directory inside the current workspace (e.g. ``qa_test_2026_05_02``,
   ``workspaces/<ws>/scratch/...``, ``/tmp/...``). Edits/deletes inside these
   paths historically surfaced as repeated confirmations even though the user
   created the scratch area. This helper detects such path mentions for
   callers that still need a low-friction path signal.

2. **Session-scoped manual grant** — the ``ask_user`` confirmation popup
   exposes a "本次会话内 workspace 内的同类操作不再询问" checkbox. The
   backend persists the choice in session metadata so subsequent in-session
   file ops in the same workspace skip the gate.

Design constraints (intentionally conservative):

- NEVER demote shell commands, protected files, control-plane operations, or
  tool-declared RiskGate commit requirements.
- NEVER grant cross-session authority — every grant is scoped to the
  session metadata and to either an operation kind or a path pattern.
- NEVER auto-extend the grant; expiry is opt-in by the caller.
