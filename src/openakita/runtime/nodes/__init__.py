"""Runtime nodes for the v2 fork.

Per ADR-0007, every behaviour-bearing component in a v2 organization
implements the :class:`NodeProtocol` defined in :mod:`base`. The
supervisor (ADR-0004) and messenger (ADR-0006/ADR-0007) drive nodes
exclusively through that protocol; nothing in the supervisor reaches
into a node's internals.

This package is populated incrementally during Phase 4. Each node type
lives in its own module so future authors only have to read one file
to understand a single concern.
