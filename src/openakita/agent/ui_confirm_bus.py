"""C9b: Cross-cutting state for SSE security_confirm flows.

Ported from :mod:`openakita.core.ui_confirm_bus` per ADR-0003 and
the Phase 2 sub-commit plan in ``docs/revamp/core_audit.md``. The
legacy import path remains as a re-export shim until Phase 8
mechanical cleanup so the live test suite (C13 / C17 / C18 /
``policy_v2_c8_wire`` and friends) and ``api/server.py`` /
``api/routes/{config,sessions}.py`` keep working unchanged.

Behaviour is unchanged.

This module isolates the **UI confirmation state machine** from the v1
``PolicyEngine`` so that:

1. ``reasoning_engine`` (yields ``security_confirm`` SSE), ``gateway``
   (renders IM cards / waits for text fallback), and ``api/routes/config``
   (``/api/chat/security-confirm`` POST endpoint) all share a single
   global event/decision/pending registry without depending on
   ``core/policy.py`` (which is being phased out in C8b).

2. ``policy.py`` no longer exposes any UI confirm facade methods (C8b-3).
   Production callers (CLI, web, IM adapters) call
   ``policy_v2.confirm_resolution.apply_resolution`` for resolve-with-side-effects
   or use ``get_ui_confirm_bus()`` directly for prepare/wait. The bus stays
   minimal — no allowlist writes here, by design.

3. The bus is a **module-level singleton** — it survives ``reset_policy_engine``
   automatically, fixing the C7 audit-2 regression where the v1 engine
   reset would lose pending UI confirms (previously patched by manual
   field-by-field copy in ``reset_policy_engine``; that copy is now
   redundant and removed in C9b).

State owned by the bus
======================

- ``_events: dict[str, asyncio.Event]`` — wakeup primitive per ``confirm_id``.
- ``_decisions: dict[str, str]`` — "allow_once" / "deny" / etc., set by
  ``resolve()`` and read by ``wait_for_resolution()``.
- ``_pending: dict[str, dict]`` — sidecar payload (tool_name, params,
  session_id, needs_sandbox, created_at) registered by ``store_pending()``;
  consumed by ``resolve()`` and returned to the caller so
  ``policy_v2.confirm_resolution.apply_resolution`` can decide whether to
  also write to ``SessionAllowlistManager`` / ``UserAllowlistManager``
  based on the user's choice.

Coupling note
=============

C8b-3: the bus is fully decoupled from any allowlist manager. ``resolve()``
just wakes the waiter and returns the pending dict; the side-effect of
"this user choice should be remembered for the session/forever" is the
job of ``policy_v2.confirm_resolution.apply_resolution``, which the
production resolve callsites all funnel through.
